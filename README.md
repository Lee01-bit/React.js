React is build around the consept of components, which are the buidling blocks of react applications , these components allow you to break down the user interface into smaller , reusable pieces , that handle there own state and logic .

JSX(JavaScript XML) is the syntax used within REACT to describe what the UI should look like.

What is a component ?
components can be thought of as functions or classes that return a React element ,A component is also self-contained code that represents part of the UI(user interface).

There are two types of components : <b>Functional</b> or <b>class-based</b>

- Functional components: These are your normal JS functions that return JSX. they are used for stateless components.
- Class-based components : These are ES6 classes that extend React.Component and can hold state and lifecycle methods.
